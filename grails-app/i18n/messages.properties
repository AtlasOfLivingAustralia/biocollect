aekos.sampling.design=Please select a sampling design that best describes how your data collection approach was established
aekos.sampling.design.help=From the list please select a scientific sampling design that you believe best represents the design approach taken in defining the datasets study locations and monitoring protocols. Any study is an information-gathering exercise where variation is present whether under the control of the data collector or not. It is not possible to gather information or measurements on every single item and not to do so does create the possibility of sampling bias or error. To minimise these types or errors and to collect quantitative data, project officers design studies using a relevant sampling design or program. Some common sampling designs are listed here but these can morph into customised designs depending on the study. For more information google experimental design.

aekos.measurement.theme=What types of measurements or observations does the dataset include?
aekos.measurement.theme.help=Data can be either direct observations or measurements collected from a source (raw data) or derived from other sources such as rainfall records from the Bureau of Meterology, values extracted from Geoscience Australia spatial layers (derived data). These can be further divided into different data types such as continuous data (numbers that are real with decimal values, e.g., temperature, height, weight), count data (positive numbers 1,2,3..), binary data (1/0, yes/no, true/false), categorical data ( i.e., classes such as the Braun-Blanquet cover abundance scale, blood type, age classes) and ordinal (relative score used especially for ranking information). Less common are multivariate data.
