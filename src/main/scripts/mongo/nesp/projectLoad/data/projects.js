    "Project summary": "The Climate Systems Hub is responsible for driving the cross-NESP Climate Adaptation Mission to improve Australiaâ€™s adaptative capacity and resilience to climate change. This project establishes the mission scope through an end-user focused and co-design approach. Using targeted scoping reviews, stakeholder engagement, partnerships and analysis of end-user needs the project will identify and prioritise adaptation research and supporting climate services, synthesis and communication and case studies to meet the aims of the Climate Adaptation Mission. It will build connections between stakeholders, Indigenous partners, scientists, and knowledge brokers to develop a program of work that is targeted, fit-for-purpose and builds on existing knowledge and capacity. It will also work to support mission-led research in support of the other three hubs. Outputs include: a Climate Adaptation Mission Strategic Plan, scoping of opportunities to deliver climate information, tools and decision-support, an approach to delivering pathway to impact projects and priority projects to include in RP2022.",
